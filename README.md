# SearchAlgorithm
Simple examples of Linear, Binary, and Recursive Binary Search Algorithms for future to myself.

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Recursive Binary Search

# Linear Search

The LinearSearch class provides a static method linearSearch that performs a linear search on an array to find a target element. The method returns the index of the target element if found, otherwise it returns -1.

To run the linear search algorithm:

- Update the data array in the main method with your own array.
- Set the key variable to the target element you want to search for.
- Execute the program.
- The program will display the index of the target element if found, or a message indicating that the target element does not exist in the array.

# Binary Search

The BinarySearch class provides an iterative implementation of the binary search algorithm. The binarySearch method performs a binary search on a sorted array to find a target element. It returns the index of the target element if found, otherwise it returns -1.

To run the binary search algorithm:

- Update the list array in the main method with your own sorted array.
- Set the key variable to the target element you want to search for.
- Execute the program.
- The program will display the index of the target element if found, or a message indicating that the target element is not in the list.

# Recursive Binary Search

The RecursiveBinarySearch class provides a recursive implementation of the binary search algorithm. The recursiveBinarySearch method performs a binary search on a sorted array to find a target element. It returns the index of the target element if found, otherwise it returns -1.

To run the recursive binary search algorithm:

- Update the data array in the main method with your own sorted array.
- Set the key variable to the target element you want to search for.
- Execute the program.
- The program will display the index of the target element if found, or a message indicating that the target element does not exist in the array.

Note: Ensure that the arrays used for binary search are sorted in ascending order for accurate results.
